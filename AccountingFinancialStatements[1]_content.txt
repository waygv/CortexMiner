Accounting Financial Statements 
 
In accounting, it is important to be able to compose and interpret financial statements. Being 
able to do this will allow investors, accountants, and lenders to determine the financial health 
of a company. This handout will explain how to prepare each financial statement, including the 
income statement, statement of retained earnings, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.  
 
Important Terms 
You can click each term to navigate to specific sections of this handout. 
Income statement: This is the first financial statement prepared. The income statement is 
prepared to look at a company’s revenues and expenses over a certain period, such as a month, 
a quarter, or a year. When expenses are subtracted from revenues, the result is net income.  
 
Statement of retained earnings: This is the second financial statement prepared. This statement 
shows how much of a company’s earnings were kept within the company and not paid out via 
dividends (the earnings distributed to a company’s shareholders).  
 
Balance sheet: This is the third financial statement prepared. The balance sheet shows a 
company’s financial position at any point in time, rather than over a period. To prepare a 
company’s balance sheet, all that is needed is the company’s assets, liabilities, and equity. 
 
Statement of cash flows: This is the last financial statement prepared. The statement of cash 
flows lists the cash inflows and outflows for a company over a period, such as a month, a 
quarter, or a year. 
 
Income Statement 
When doing income statements, it is important to account for all types of revenues and 
expenses. For example, common types of revenue accounts include sales, commissions, fees 
earned, interest revenue, and service revenue. Common types of expense accounts include 
depreciation expense, salary expense, rent expense, utilities expense, income tax expense, and 
interest expense. The reason the income statement is prepared first is because the final 
product is net income, which is needed for the statement of retained earnings.

Example:  
ABC Company had a total revenue of $55,000 during the fiscal year, ending on December 31st. 
Of the company’s total revenue, $50,000 was from service revenue, $4,000 was from sales, and 
$1,000 was from fees earned. Also, ABC Company had $28,000 in total expenses. Of the 
expenses, $10,000 came from paying employee salaries, $8,000 came from rent expenses, and 
$5,000 came from interest expenses. Furthermore, ABC Company had $3,000 of income tax 
expenses, $1,000 in depreciation expenses, $1,000 of utility expenses. A class assignment may 
require students to complete an income statement that would look like the following table.

It should be noted that the net income of $27,000 was calculated by subtracting the total 
expenses of $28,000 from the total revenues of $55,000. ABC Company’s net income will be 
used to prepare the next financial statement, which is the statement of retained earnings.

Statement of Retained Earnings 
The reason this is the second statement to prepare is because the retained earnings are needed 
to prepare the equity section of the balance sheet. The first item needed to determine a 
company’s retained earnings for a period is to record the retained earnings from the beginning 
of the period. Next, add the company’s net income from the income statement to the amount 
of retained earnings at the beginning of the period. Finally, subtract how much money was paid 
in dividends to the company’s shareholders.  
Example: 
The following table shows ABC Company’s retained earnings as of the end of the fiscal year on 
December 31st. It should be noted that ABC Company started the year with $12,000 in retained 
earnings. They also had a net income of $27,000 for year, which was calculated by preparing 
the income statement. Lastly, they paid out $4,000 in dividends to company shareholders 
during the fiscal year. A class assignment may require students to complete a statement of 
retained earnings for ABC Company that would look like the following table.

In this example, ABC Company started the fiscal year with $12,000. After adding $27,000 to that 
amount, the running total is $39,000. Next, $4,000 is subtracted from that to account for 
dividend payments. Therefore, ABC Company ends the year with $35,000 in retained earnings. 
The $35,000 in retained earnings will be needed to prepare the equity section of the next 
financial statement, the balance sheet.

Balance Sheet 
The balance sheet is prepared using the accounting equation formula. Therefore, it should be 
set up as assets = liabilities + equity. The company’s asset accounts should be recorded on the 
left side of the page, while its liabilities and equity accounts should be recorded on the right 
side of the page. Assets are any tangible item of value that a company owns. Common 
examples of assets are cash, accounts receivable, land, equipment, and inventory. Liabilities are 
debts the company owes to other entities, such as lenders, sellers, and other companies. 
Common examples of liabilities are accounts payable, wages payable, notes payable, and taxes 
payable. The difference between a company’s assets and liabilities is the company’s equity. 
Within the equity section of the balance sheet, the company’s retained earnings and common 
stock are listed. The reason the balance sheet is the third statement prepared is because the 
cash account balance in assets is needed for the statement of cash flows. The following table 
shows ABC Company’s balance sheet on December 31st. 
Example: 
On December 31st, ABC Company had $75,000 in total assets. Of their assets, they had $50,000 
in cash, $20,000 in inventory, and $5,000 in accounts receivable. ABC Company also had 
$27,000 in total liabilities. Of their liabilities, they had $15,000 in wages payable, $6,000 in 
accounts payable, $3,000 in taxes payable, and $3,000 in notes payable. In addition, ABC 
Company had $48,000 in equity. Of their equity, they had $13,000 in common stock and 
$35,000 in retained earnings. A class assignment may require students to complete a balance 
sheet for ABC Company that would look like the following table.

In the example above, it should be noted that the value of the total assets equals the value of 
the total liabilities and equity combined, which is $75,000 for each. Also, remember that the 
retained earnings from the previous statement were used to prepare the equity section of the 
balance sheet. To prepare the next statement, which is the statement of cash flows, the cash 
account balance in the assets section will be needed. Therefore, the $50,000 in cash will be 
used to prepare the statement of cash flows.  
 
Statement of Cash Flows 
The statement of cash flows is divided into three sections. The first section is the cash flows 
from operating activities. Examples of operating activity accounts include wages, salaries, 
interest payments, interest income, cash receipts from customers, and cash paid to vendors. 
The second section is the cash flows from investing activities. For example, investing cash flows 
could be the buying and selling of an asset, such as equipment. The third section is the cash 
flows from financing activities. Examples of financing cash flows would be dividends paid to 
shareholders, cash investments by investors, bond issuances, and repayment of loans. The sum 
of net cash flows from all three activities should equal the cash balance in the cash account 
from the balance sheet. Additionally, there are two different methods to prepare the statement 
of cash flows: the direct method and the indirect method.  
 
The following example shows ABC Company’s statement of cash flows for the fiscal year that 
ended on December 31st. ABC Company uses the direct method in the following example. It 
should be noted that account balances in parentheses indicate a negative balance for that 
account.  
 
Example: 
At the beginning of the fiscal year, ABC Company had $0 in cash. During the year, they 
increased that amount by $50,000, to end with $50,000. ABC Company accumulated a net total 
of $52,000 from operating activities.  Even though they received $70,000 cash from customer 
receipts, they paid $10,000 to vendors and $8,000 for rent. ABC Company had a negative 
balance of $18,000 for investing activities during the year. Of that $18,000, $12,000 went 
toward purchasing vehicles, $4,000 went toward purchasing computer equipment, and $2,000 
went toward purchasing furniture. For financing activities, ABC Company accumulated a net 
total of $16,000. Even though they received $26,000 in investments from investors, they still 
paid $6,000 towards their bank loan, and $4,000 via dividends toward their shareholders. A 
class assignment may require students to complete a statement of cash flows for ABC Company 
that would look like the table on the following page.

It should be noted that the ending cash balance equals the cash balance on the balance sheet, 
which is $50,000. The $50,000 was calculated by adding the net cash from operating, investing, 
and financing activities. It should also be noted that ABC Company started the fiscal year with 
$0 in cash and increased that amount to $50,000 cash by the end of the year.
